# hass-aarlo

Asynchronous Arlo component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

The component operates in a similar way to the [Arlo](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) website - it opens a single event stream to the Arlo backend and monitors events and state changes for all base stations, cameras and doorbells in a system.

## Changelog

### 0.6.0

1. Arlo Light support. Brightness and colour will be added soon.
2. Switches for controlling Alarms and Camera snapshots.

## Notes
Wherever you see `/config` in this README it refers to your home-assistant configuration directory. For me, for example, it's `/home/steve/ha` that is mapped to `/config` inside my docker container.

## Thanks
Many thanks to:
* [Pyarlo](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-arlo) and [Arlo](https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo) for doing all the hard work figuring the API out and the free Python lesson!
* [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient) for reading from the event stream
* [Button Card](https://github.com/kuuji/button-card/blob/master/button-card.js) for a working lovelace card I could understand
* [![JetBrains](/images/jetbrains.svg)](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=hass-aarlo) for the excellent **PyCharm IDE** and providing me with an open source license to speed up the project development.

## Installation

### HACS
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
Aarlo is part of the default HACS store. If you're not interested in development branches this is the easiest way to install.

### Manually
Copy the `aarlo` directory into your `/config/custom_components` directory.

### From Script
Run the install script. Run it once to make sure the operations look sane and run it a second time with the `go` paramater to do the actual work. If you update just rerun the script, it will overwrite all installed files.

```sh
install /config
# check output looks good
install go /config
```

### Migrating from Old Layout
This only needs to be done once and only if you installed an older version of `hass-aarlo`.

Home Assitant moved to a new layout for custom components, running the `remove_old` script will show a list of commands needed to remove the old installation. You will need to enter these commands manually. After running the command and, if they are empty, it's safe to remove the `alarm_control_panel`, `binary_sensor`, `sensor` and `camera` directories from your `/config/custom_components` directory

## Component Configuration
For the simplest use replace all instances of the `arlo` with `aarlo` in your home-assistant configuration files. To support motion and audio capture add `aarlo` as a platform to the `binary_sensor` list.

### Sample Configuration

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
  db_motion_time: 30
  db_ding_time: 10
  recent_time: 10
  last_format: '%m-%d %H:%M'
  refresh_devices_every: 2

camera:
  - platform: aarlo
    ffmpeg_arguments: '-pred 1 -q:v 2'

alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: aarlo
    home_mode_name: home
    away_mode_name: armed
    trigger_time: 30
    alarm_volume: 8

binary_sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - motion
    - sound
    - ding

sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - last_capture
    - total_cameras
    - battery_level
    - captured_today
    - signal_strength

light:
  - platform: aarlo

switch:
  - platform: aarlo
    siren: True
    all_sirens: True
    snapshot: True
    siren_volume: 1
    siren_duration: 10
```

The `alarm_control_panel` can be triggered and a siren, if present, will sound.

### Advanced Platform Parameters
The following additional parameters can be specified against the aarlo platform for more granular control:

| Field  | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `packet_dump`           | boolean  | `False`                 | Causes aarlo to store all the packets it sees in `/config/.aarlo/packets.dump` file |
| `db_motion_time`        | integer  | `30` (s)                | Duration of doorbell motion. (Arlo doorbell only indicates motion is present not that it stops) |
| `db_ding_time`          | integer  | `60` (s)                | Duration of doorbell press. (Arlo doorbell only indicates doorbell was pressed, not that it was released) |
| `recent_time`           | integer  | `600` (s)               | Used to hold the cameras in a  recent activity state after a recording or streaming event. (Streaming & recording can be over in a few seconds, without this the camera will revert to idle, possibly looking like nothing has happened.) |
| `last_format`           | strftime | `'%m-%d %H:%M'`         | Display format of last captured time  |
| `conf_dir`              | string   | `'/config/.aarlo'`      | Location to store component state. (The default is fine for hass.io, docker, and virtualenv systems - don't set this value unless asked to.) |
| `no_media_upload`       | boolean  | `False`                 | Used as a workaround for Arlo issues where the camera never gets a media upload notification. (Not needed in most cases.) |
| `mode_api`              | string   | `auto`                | available options: [`v1`, `v2`] You can override this by setting this option to  v1 or v2 to use the old or new version exclusively. The default is  auto, choose based on device |
| `refresh_devices_every` | integer  | `0` (hours)             | Used to force a refresh every x hours. 0 = no refreshing. Used to resolve issue with mode changes failing after several days of use |
| `http_connections`      | integer  | `5`                     | Adjust the number http connections pools to cache |
| `http_max_size`         | integer  | `10`                    | Adjust the maximum number connects to save in the pool |
| `host`                  | string   | `https://my.arlo.com` | Sets the host aarlo will connect to |


For `alarm_control_panel` you only need to specify the modes if you have custom mode names, see [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/arlo/#alarm) for more information. Names are case insensitive.

### Switches
The switch component doesn't directly map to a single Arlo components but provides you with shortcuts to perform certain actions.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| siren | boolean | `False` | If True provides a switch per base/camera with siren support |
| all_sirens | boolean | `False` | If True provides a switch to operate all sirens simultaneously |
| snapshot | False | `True` | If True provide a switch per camera to request a snapshot |
| siren_volume | integer | `8` | Set siren volume |
| siren_duration | integer | `300` | Siren duration in seconds |

## Custom Lovelace Card Configuration

A custom Lovelace card which is based on the `picture-glance` can be found here: https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo

*This piece is optional, `aarlo` will work with the standard Lovelace cards.*

## Services

The component provides the following services:

| Service | Parameters | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `camera.aarlo_request_snapshot` | `entity_id` - camera to get snapshot from | This requests a snapshot be taken. Camera will move from  taking_snapshot state when finished |
| `camera.aarlo_request_snapshot_to_file` | `entity_id` - camera to get snapshot from<br/>`filename` - where to save snapshot | This requests a snapshot be taken and written to the passed file. Camera will move from  taking_snapshot state when finished |
| `camera.aarlo_stop_activity` | `entity_id` - camera to get snapshot from | This moves the camera into the idle state. Can be used to stop streaming |
| `camera.start_recording` | `entity_id` - camera to start recording<br>`duration` - amount of time in seconds to record | Begins video capture from the specified camera |
| `camera.stop_recording` | `entity_id` - camera to stop recording | Ends video capture from the specified camera |
| `alarm_control_panel.aarlo_set_mode` | `entity_id` - camera to get snapshot from<br/>`mode` - custom mode to change to | Set the alarm to a custom mode |

## Automations

#### Update camera snapshot 3 seconds after a recording event happens

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0100'
  alias: Camera Snapshot
  trigger:
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'idle'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2

    from: 'recently active'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
    service: camera.aarlo_request_snapshot
```

#### Begin recording when an entity changes state

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0101'
  alias: Record video when garage opens
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: cover.garage_door
    platform: state
    to: open
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      duration: 300
      entity_id: camera.aarlo_garage
    service: camera.aarlo_start_recording
```

## Web Sockets

The component provides the following extra web sockets:

| Service | Parameters | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| aarlo_video_url | <ul><li>`entity_id` - camera to get details from</li><ul> | Request details of the last recorded video. Returns: <ul><li>`url` - video url</li><li>`url_type` - video type</li><li>`thumbnail` - thumbnail image url</li><li>`thumbnail_type` - thumbnail image type</li></ul> |
| aarlo_library | <ul><li>`at-most` - return at most this number of entries</li><ul> | Request up the details of `at-most` recently recorded videos. Returns an array of:<ul><li>`created_at`: unix time stamp</li><li>`created_at_pretty`: pretty version of the create time</li><li>`url`: URL of the video</li><li>`url_type`: video type</li><li>`thumbnail`: URL of the thumbnail</li><li>`thumbnail_type`: thumbnail type</li><li>`object`: object in the video that triggered the capture</li><li>`object_region`: region in the video that triggered the capture</li></ul> |
| aarlo_stream_url | <ul><li>`entity_id` -  camera to get snapshot from</li><li>`filename` - where to save snapshot | Ask the camera to start streaming. Returns:<ul><li>`url` - URL of the video stream</li></ul> |
| aarlo_snapshot_image | <ul><li>`entity_id` -  camera to get snapshot from</li></ul> | Request a snapshot. Returns image details: <ul><li>`content_type`: the image type</li><li>`content`: the image</li></ul> |
| aarlo_stop_activity | <ul><li>`entity_id` - camera to stop activity on</li></ul> | Stop all the activity in the camera. Returns: <ul><li>`stopped`: True if stop request went in</li></ul> |

## Streaming

The support for stream is experimental and works but with a couple of caveats.
* virtualenv only - this is because `ffmpeg` doesn't support rtsps streams in docker or hassio.
* the stream only stops if you use the aarlo-glance card

Do get streaming working in `virtualenv` you still need to make sure a couple of libraries are installed. For `ubuntu` the following works:
```
source your-env/bin/activate
sudo apt install libavformat-dev
sudo apt install libavdevice-dev
pip install av==6.1.2
```

Set `image_click` to `play` on the aarlo glance card.

For further information on getting streaming working please read these 2 posts:

## To Do

* custom mode - like SmartThings to better control motion detection
* enhance live streaming
* use asyncio loop internally
* setup pypi
