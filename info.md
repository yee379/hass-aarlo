# Asynchronous Arlo Component for Home Assistant.

An (almost) drop in replacement for the standard [Arlo](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) package.

Please visit the [Readme](https://github.com/twrecked/hass-aarlo/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

## Features

It provides:

- Acces to cameras, base stations, sirens, doorbells and lights.
- Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion and sound events.
- Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from cameras.
- Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
- Special switches to trip alarms and take snapshots from cameras.
- Enhanced state notifications.

There is also a resource [`aarlo-glance`](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo) which is based on `picture-glance` but tailored for the Arlo component.
